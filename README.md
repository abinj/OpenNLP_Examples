# OpenNLP_Examples

* The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for processing of natural language text. It includes a sentence detector, a tokenizer, a name finder, a parts-of-speech (POS) tagger, a chunker, and a parser.

  In this Repository, I will show you how to use Apache OpenNLP through a set of simple examples.

1. Sentence Detector
2. Tokenizer
3. Name Finder
4. POS Tagger
5. Chunker
6. Parser


##Sentence Detector
    Sentence detector is for detecting sentence boundaries.
    
    The trained openNLP model "en-sent.bin" used for this.
    
    
##Tokenizer
    Tokens are usually words which are separated by space, but there are exceptions. 
    For example, "isn't" gets split into "is" and "n't, since it is a a brief format of "is not".

    The trained openNLP model "en-token.bin" used for this operation. 




NOTES : All the required trained models are included in this repo, only need to provide proper path to the files.
